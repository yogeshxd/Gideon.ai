# Adding your custom extension in different browsers:

## Firefox

In Firefox: Open the [about:debugging](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/about_colon_debugging/index.html) page, click the This Firefox option, click the Load Temporary Add-on button, then select any file in your extension's directory.

The extension now installs, and remains installed until you restart Firefox.

Alternatively, you can run the extension from the command line using the [web-ext](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/) tool.

## Chrome
**Important:** You can't add extensions when you browse in Incognito mode or as a guest.
 - Open the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions).
 - Find and select the extension you want.
 - Click Add to Chrome.
 - Some extensions will let you know if they need certain permissions or data. To approve, click Add extension.

## These steps to install custom extension in chrome works for mostly every other browser. Still if you are having trouble finding guides for your specific browser, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/yogeshxd/Gideon.ai/issues).
